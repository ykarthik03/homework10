## Reflection

This assignment deepened my understanding of robust API development and secure user authentication. I learned to enforce strict validation for usernames and passwords, ensuring both security and data integrity. Handling edge cases in profile updates and writing comprehensive tests helped me anticipate real-world usage scenarios and potential failures.

Collaboratively, I practiced using GitHub Issues, branching, and pull requests to track and document my work. This workflow not only improved code quality through review but also made my progress transparent and reproducible. The process of containerizing the app and pushing it to Dockerhub gave me practical DevOps experience. Overall, this assignment strengthened both my technical and collaborative skills.
